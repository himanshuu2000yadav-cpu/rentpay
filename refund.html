<h2>Refund Policy</h2>

<p>
EasyRent Pay does not directly provide refunds once a payment
has been successfully processed.
</p>

<p>
Refunds, if applicable, are subject to the agreement between
the payer and the beneficiary.
</p>

<p>
In case of failed or reversed transactions, the amount will be
credited back to the original payment method as per bank or
payment partner timelines.
</p>

<p>
For any refund-related queries, please contact the beneficiary directly.
